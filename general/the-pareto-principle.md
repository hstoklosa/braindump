# The Pareto Principle
- The Pareto Principle (or **80/20 rule**) is the broad observation that approximately **80% of outcomes** come from about **20% of your inputs**.
- Therefore you should concentrate on areas where you can get 'big wins' with comparatively 'little effort'.
- For example: the 80/20 rule can be applied to studying by:
  - focusing on **high-yield topics** i.e., the stuff that gets big marks
  - using **active learning techniques** that can offer **better results with less time invested**
## Using the Pareto Principle when studying

1. **Set a Goal:** Define what you’re aiming to **achieve** with your study session.
2. **Identify key topics**: Not all subjects within a course are created equal...
   - Identify the important stuff: the (roughly) **20%** of material or tasks that will contribute to about **80%** of the exams or assignments.
   - Focus on going through that information.
   - Don't get hung up on the 20/80 proportions — they're just a guiding principle
3. **Revise, and practice 'Active Learning':** Study the material through *active* methods like summarisation, teaching others, and solving problems (don't just passively read the material).
4. **Evaluate and re-strategise**: After a test or exam, **review** the performance:
   - Did the **20%** of topics actually yield **about 80% of the marks**? If not, adjust your approach.

## Using the Pareto Principle when reading

### Step 1: Pre-reading scan

- **Skim through headings:** Quickly glance through the chapter or article’s headings and subheadings to get an **overall idea of the content**.
- **Highlight 'important' sections:** Identify which sections include the **main arguments** or **important data**.

### Step 2: The reading

- **Start with these 'important' sections:** Rather than reading from start to finish, jump directly to the sections you’ve identified as key.
  - This is the '**20%**' that is likely to provide 80% of the value.
  - It might include the introduction and summaries — so you know the information.
- **In-depth reading of 'important' sections:** Read these sections carefully, taking notes and highlighting important points.
- **Quick scan of the rest:** A lighter read or skim can suffice for the remaining sections.
  - The aim here is just to **fill in the gaps** and **provide context** to what you’ve read in the 'important' sections.
## Advantages

- Makes studying **more efficient** by focusing on high-impact topics.
- Encourages **prioritisation** and **strategic planning**.
- **Reduces stress** by simplifying study goals.
- Allows for **self-evaluation** to refine future study strategies.
- Helps manage and **reduce information overload**.

## Disadvantages

- May **oversimplify complex subjects**.
- There is **subjectivity** in **identifying the critical '20%'**.
- Only universally applicable to *some* subjects, as others may require a more comprehensive approach.
- Risk of **neglecting important information** if not balanced carefully.
