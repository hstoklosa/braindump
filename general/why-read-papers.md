# Why Read Papers

- LinkedIn successfully used k-nearest neighbours and SVM to improve their job title classifier, achieving 95% precision and 80% recall
- Regular paper reading (1-2 papers weekly) led to this valuable knowledge sharing, which helped the team achieve 95% accuracy on their product classifier
- Learn from others' proven solutions instead of "reinventing the rocket"
- Broaden perspective through cross-domain insights (e.g., computer vision techniques helping NLP)
- Stay current with field developments, leading to improved work efficiency
- Creates a virtuous cycle: better efficiency, more time to learn, further improvement

## How to choose what papers to read?

- Start by reading papers that align with your personal interests to build the habit naturally
- Most papers offer valuable learning opportunities regardless of topic
- Choose papers based on practical needs, especially when starting new projects
- Conduct literature reviews before projects to avoid reinventing existing solutions
- Follow respected experts and subscribe to curated newsletters for quality recommendations
- Focus on work-related papers to immediately apply and reinforce learning
- Look for papers that detail both successes and failures through ablation studies
- Balance work-related papers with personal interest areas (like NLP, reinforcement learning)

## How to read papers?

First Pass

- Scan abstract to determine if paper meets research needs
- Skim through headings to identify problem statement, methods, and results
- Look specifically for formula to calculate various metrics
- Complete first pass on all papers before starting second pass
- Approximately 50% of papers advance to second pass

Second Pass

- Review each paper again and highlight relevant sections
- Highlighting enables quick reference to important portions later
- Take focused notes, primarily on metrics (methods, formula)
- For literature reviews on applications (recsys, product classification, fraud detection), notes focus on methods, system design, and results

Third Pass

- Synthesize common concepts across papers into consolidated notes
- Combine different methods of measuring novelty, diversity, serendipity into single note
- Compare pros and cons of different approaches
- Process reveals knowledge gaps requiring return to original papers
