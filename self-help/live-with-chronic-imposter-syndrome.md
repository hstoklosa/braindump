# How to Live with Chronic Imposter Syndrome

- Tricks to solve the feeling of being a fraud that consist of a shift in mindset and behavioural changes.
- Everyone starts as a beginner with no experience, from engineers to surgeons
- Many important achievements had no formal prerequisites (Wright brothers, JK Rowling, parenting)
- Tim Urban [puts it](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html): _"You don’t know shit. But no one else knows shit either. Everyone’s playing Grand Theft Life and trying to figure it out."_
- Albert Einstein felt like an "involuntary swindler" despite his Nobel Prize
- Maya Angelou felt like a fraud even after writing eleven successful books
- Meryl Streep doubted her acting abilities despite multiple Academy Awards
- Professional recognition and accolades don't cure imposter syndrome
- Imposter syndrome often occurs when doing new things among skilled people
- The conditions that cause imposter syndrome (new challenges, being out of depth) are the same that lead to growth
- If you're not feeling any strain or challenge, you might not be growing
- Feeling like an imposter can be a sign that you're pushing yourself to learn
- Asking for help doesn't make you an imposter - it shows awareness and transparency
- Do basic research/self-learning before asking for help
- When asking for help: provide context, make it easy to respond, listen to feedback, show gratitude
- Keep a "brag document" tracking achievements and milestones
- Maintain a "wall of awesome" with positive feedback received
- Take breaks from challenging projects to work on smaller, achievable tasks
- Fast feedback from smaller tasks can boost confidence
- Avoid comparing yourself to others
- Focus on your unique contributions and strengths
- Rely on others to complement your weak areas
- Imposter syndrome can hamper confidence and career growth
- However, it can be "rocket fuel" for learning and growth
- Keeps ego in check
- Feeling unqualified, scared, and out of depth can be signs you're challenging yourself appropriately
