## 5.4 Limits
Limits are the mathematically precise way to talk about infinity.
### Example
Suppose you have a string of length $\ell$ and you want to divide it into infinitely many, infinitely short segments. You want to divide the string infinitely many, infinitely short segments, so together the segments add to the string’s total length $\ell$.

Dividing $\ell$ into $N$ equal pieces, then each piece will have a length of $$\delta = \frac{\ell}{N}$$
Ensure that $N$ pieces of length $\delta$ added together equal the string’s total length $$N\delta = N\frac{\ell}{N} = \ell$$
The larger the $N$, the shorter pieces of string will become. In fact, if $N \to \infty$, then the pieces of string will have zero length: $$\lim_{N\ \to\ \infty} \delta = \lim_{N\ \to\ \infty} \frac{\ell}{N} = 0$$
In the limit as $N \to \infty$, the pieces of string are _infinitely small_.

**Note**: even if the pieces of string are infinitely small, because there are infinitely many of them, they still add to $\ell$ $$\lim_{N \to \infty} (N\delta) = \lim_{N \to \infty} \left(N\frac{\ell}{N}\right) = \ell$$
_As long as you clearly define your limits, you can use infinitely small numbers in your calculations._
### Limits at infinity
Describing what happens to $f(n)$ when its input variable tends to infinity helps us draw the function’s graph. 

Does $f(x)$ approach a finite number, or does it keep on growing to $\infty$?

#### Example
Consider the limit of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ as $x$ goes to infinity: $$\lim_{x\ \to\ \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x\ \to\ \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0$$
This is true even though $f(x)$ never reaches $0$, it gets closer and closer to the $x$-axis but never touches it.

This is why the concept of a limit is useful: it allows us to write $\lim_{x\ \to\ \infty}$ even though $f(x)\neq 0$ for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

The function $f(x)$ is said to _converge_ to the number $L$ if it approaches the value $L$ for large values of $x$. 
- “the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to infinity is the number $L$” $$\lim_{x\ \to\ \infty} f(x) = L$$
	
- The limit expression summarises a mathematical statement: $$\forall \epsilon > 0\ \exists S \in \mathbb{R}\ \ \text{ s.t., } \forall x \geq S \: |\ f(x) - L\ | < \epsilon$$
	- for _any_ precision $\epsilon > 0$
	- there exists a starting point $S$
	- after which $f(x)$ equals $L$ within a precision $\epsilon$. 

The limit equation $\lim_{x\ \to\ \infty} f(x) = L$ states that the “limit at infinity” of $f(x)=L$.

This statement is true if and only if there exists a winning strategy for an $\epsilon$, $S$-game, similar to the $\epsilon$, $N$-game played by the computer scientist and mathematician.

### Limits to a number
The limit of $f(x)$ approaching $x = a$ _from the right_ is defined as: $$\lim_{x\ \to\ a^+} f(x) = \lim_{\delta\ \to\ 0} f(a + \delta)$$
To find the limit from the right at $a$, we let $x$ take on values like $a+ 0.1$, $a+ 0.01$, $a + 0.001$, etc. The graph shows $f(x$) near point $(a, f(a))$.

To prove $\lim_{x\ \to\ a^+} f(x) = L$, show that:
$$\forall \epsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0\ \ \text{ s.t., } \forall x \in (a, a + \delta) \quad |f(x) - L| < \epsilon$$

The limit of $f(x)$ when $x$ approaches _from the left_ is defined analogously: $$\lim_{x\ \to\ a^-} f(x) = \lim_{\delta\ \to\ 0} f(a - \delta)$$
If both limits exist and are equal to each other, we can talk about the limit as $x \to a$ without specifying the direction of approach: $$\lim_{x\ \to\ a} f(x) = \lim_{x\ \to\ a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\  \to\ a^-} f(x)$$

![[5.04-limit-numbers-2.png|center|250]]


For the two-sided limit of a function to exist at a point, both the limit from the left and the limit from the right must converge to the same number.

If the function $f(x)$ obeys, $f(a) = L$ and $\lim_{x\ \to\ a} f(x) = L$, then the function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x = a$.

### Continuity
A function is said to be _continuous_ if its graph looks like a smooth curve without any 
- sudden jumps 
- gaps.

A mathematical way to define continuity is to say that the function is equal to its limit for all $x$. We say a function $f(x)$ is _continuous_ at $a$ if the limit of $f$ as $x \to a$ converges to $f(a)$: $$\lim_{x\ \to\ a} f(x) = f(a)$$
**Remember**: 2-sided limit $\lim_{x\ \to\ a}$ requires both sides to exist and to be equal. Thus, the definition of continuity implies the following equality: $$\lim_{x\ \to\ a^-} f(x) = f(a) = \lim_{x\ \to\ a^+} f(x)$$
Functions that are not defined for some value, as well as functions that make sudden jumps, are not continuous.  

This function is continuous from the right at the point $x = 3$, since $\lim_{x\ \to\ 3}+f(x) = 1 = f (3)$. However, not continuous from the left $\lim_{x\ \to\ 3}+f(x) = -1 \neq f (3)$.
$$f(x) = \frac{|x-3|}{x-3} = \begin{cases}\ \ \ 1 & \text{if } x > 3, \\ -1 & \text{if } x < 3. \end{cases}$$

### Asymptotes
An _asymptote_ of the function $f(x)$ is a line the function approaches but never touches.
- e.g., line $y = 0$ (the $x$-axis) is an asymptote of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ as $x$ goes to infinity.

A _vertical asymptote_ is a vertical line that the function approaches.
- $f(x) = \frac{1}{3−x}$ has a vertical asymptote at $x = 3$. $$\lim_{x\ \to\ 3^-} \frac{1}{3-x} = \infty$$
- When $f(x)$ approaches $x = 3$ from the left, the number in the denominator gets smaller and smaller, thus the fraction grows larger and larger.

**Note**: the function is not defined at the exact value $x = 3$. Nevertheless, the above limit allows us to describe what happens to the function near that point.

### Limits for derivatives
The formal definition of a function’s derivative is expressed in terms of the rise-over-run formula for an infinitesimally short run: $$f'(x) = \lim_{\delta\ \to\ 0} \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \lim_{\delta\ \to\ 0} \frac{f(x + \delta) - f(x)}{x + \delta - x}$$
### Limit for integrals
One way to approximate the area under the curve $f(x)$ between $x = a$ and $x = b$ is to:
- split the area into $N$ little rectangles of width $\epsilon = \frac{b-a}{N}$ and height $f(x)$
- then calculate the sum of the areas of the rectangles: 

$$A(a,b) \approx \underbrace{\epsilon f(a) + \epsilon f(a + \epsilon) + \epsilon f(a + 2\epsilon) + \cdots + \epsilon f(b - \epsilon)}_{N \text{ terms}}$$
We obtain the exact value of the area in the limit where we split the area into an infinite number of rectangles with infinitely small width: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = A(a,b) = \lim_{N\ \to\ \infty} [\epsilon f(a) + \epsilon f(a + \epsilon) + \epsilon f(a + 2\epsilon) + \cdots + \epsilon f(b - \epsilon)]$$
Computing the area under a function by splitting the area into infinitely many rectangles is known as a _Riemann sum_.
### Limits for series
Limits are used to describe the convergence properties of series.

**For example:** the partial sum of the first $N$ terms of the geometric series $a_n = r^n$ corresponds to: $$S_N = \sum_{n=0}^{N} r^n = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \cdots + r^N$$
The _series_ $a_n$ is defined as the limit $N \to \infty$ of the above expression. 
For values of $r$ such that $|r| < 1$, the series converges: $$S_{\infty} = \lim_{N\ \to\ \infty} S_N = \sum_{n\ =\ 0}^{\infty} r^n = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \cdots = \frac{1}{1-r}$$
