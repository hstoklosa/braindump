## 1.14 Function reference
### Line
The equation of a line describes an input-output relationship where the change in the output is _proportional_ to the change in the input.
$$f(x) = mx + b$$
where constant $m$ describes the slope of the line and constant $b$ is the _y-intercept_ — value of the function when $x = 0$

![[./images/1.14-linear.jpg|center|500]]
#### Properties
- Domain: $x ∈ \mathbb{R}$ - defined for all input values $x ∈ \mathbb{R}$
- Image: $x ∈ \mathbb{R}$ if $m \neq 0$. If $m = 0$ the function is constant.
  $f(x) = b$, so the image set contains only a single number $\{b\}$.
- $b/m$: the x-intercept of $f(x) = mx + b$, obtained by solving $f(x) = 0$.
- A unique line passes through any two points $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ if $x_{1} \neq x_2$.
- The inverse to the line $f(x) = mx + b$ is $f^{−1}(x) = \frac{1}{m}(x − b)$, which is also a line.

#### General equation
A line can also be described in a more symmetric form as a relation:
$$Ax + By = C$$
Given the general equation of a line, you can convert to the function form $y = f(x) = mx + b$ using $b = \frac{C}{B}$ and $m = \frac{−A}{B}$.
### Square
The formula for the quadratic function (or parabola) is:
$$f(x)=x^2$$

![[1.14-quadratic.jpg|center|500]]
#### Properties
- Domain: $x ∈ \mathbb{R}$
- Image: $f(x) \in [0, \infty$
- $x^2$ is the inverse of the square root function $\sqrt{x}$.
- $f(x) = x^2$ is _two-to-one:_ it sends both $x$ and $−x$ to the same output value $x^2 = (−x)^2$.
- The quadratic function is *convex* — it curves upward.
### Square root
The square root function is denoted as:
$$f(x) = \sqrt{x} \equiv \frac{1}{2}$$
The square root is the inverse function of the square function for $x \geq 0$. The symbol $\sqrt{c}$ refers to the positive solution of $x^2 = c$. $-\sqrt{c}$ is also a solution of $x^2 = c$.

 ![[1.14-square-root.jpg|center|500]]
#### Properties
- Domain: $x \in [0, \infty$
  The function is only defined for non-negative inputs $x \geq 0$.
  There is no real number $y$ such that $y^2$ is negative, hence is not defined for negative $x$.
- Image: $f(x) \in [0, \infty$
  The outputs of the function are never negative: $\sqrt{x} \geq 0$, for all $x \in [0, \infty$.

In general, we can define the $n^{th}$ root function $\sqrt[n]{x}$ as the inverse function of $x^n$.
### Absolute value
The absolute value function specifies the _size_ of numbers, ignoring the sign. Thus, a number’s absolute value corresponds to its distance from the origin of the number line.
$$f(x) = |x| = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$$

![[1.14-absolute.jpg|center|500]]
#### Properties
- Always returns a non-negative number
- The combination of square followed by square-root is equivalent to the absolute function.
### Polynomial functions
The general equation for a polynomial function of degree $n$:
$$f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^2+a_{3}x^3+\dots+a_{n}x^n$$
The constants $a_i$ are known as the **coefficients**.
#### Parameters
- $n$: the _degree_ of the polynomial
- $a_{0}$: the constant term
- $a_1$: the *linear* coefficient, or first-order coefficient
- $a_2$: the *quadratic* coefficient
- $a_3$: the *cubic* coefficient
- $a_n$: the $n^{th}$ order coefficient
#### Properties
- Domain: $x \in \mathbb{R}$ 
- Image: depends on the coefficients
- Sum of two polynomials is also a polynomial.
#### Even and odd functions
Depending on the choice of degree and coefficients, a polynomial function can take on many different shapes.

Observations about symmetries of polynomials:
- If a polynomial contains only even powers of $x$, it is an _even_ polynomial. 
	- Even polynomials have the property $f(x) = f(−x)$
	- i.e., the sign of the input doesn't matter.
- Odd polynomials have the property $g(x) = −g(−x)$.

This terminology applies to all functions.
### Sine
The sine function represents a fundamental unit of vibration. The graph of $sin(x)$ _oscillates_ up and down and crosses the $x$-axis multiple times.
$$f(x) = sin(x)$$

![[1.14-sine.jpg|center|500]]

- The graph starts from (0, 0) and smoothly increases until it reaches the maximum value at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$.
- Afterward, the function comes back down to cross the $x$-axis at $x = \pi$.
- After $\pi$, the function drops below the $x$-axis and reaches minimum value of $−1$ at $x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$.
- It then travels up again to cross the $x$-axis at $x = 2\pi$.

This $2\pi$-long cycle repeats after $x = 2\pi$, hence the function is called periodic — the shape of the graph repeats.

![[1.14-sine-3.jpg|center|center|500]]
#### Properties
- Domain: $x \in \mathbb{R}$
- Image: $sin(x) \in [−1, 1]$
- Roots: $[\dots, −3\pi, −2\pi, −\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi, 3\pi, \dots]$
	- The function $sin(x)$ has roots at all multiples of $\pi$
- The function is periodic, with period $2\pi$: $sin(x) = sin(x + 2\pi)$.
- The sin function is odd: $sin(x) = −sin(−x)$.
- Relation to cos: $sin^2x + cos^2x = 1$
- Relation to csc: $csc(x) \equiv \frac{1}{sin x}$ (csc is read cosecant)
- The inverse function of $sin(x)$ is $sin^{−1}(x)$
	- Not $(\sin(x))^{−1} = \frac{1}{\sin(x)} \equiv \csc(x)$.
	- Sometimes the function $sin^{−1}(x)$ is denoted $arcsin(x)$
- The number $\sin(\theta)$ is the length-ratio of the vertical side and the hypotenuse in a right-angle triangle with angle $\theta$ at the base.

### Cosine
The cosine function is the same as the sine function shifted by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to the left:
$$\cos(x) = \sin(x + \frac{π}{2})$$
Everything that applies to sine function also applies to the cosine function.

![[1.14-cosine.jpg|center|500]]
#### Properties
- Domain: $x \in \mathbb{R}$
- Image: $\cos(x) \in [-1, 1]$
- Roots: $[\dots, −\frac{3\pi}{2}, −\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \dots]$
- Relation to sin: $\sin^2x + cos^2x = 1$
- Relation to sec: $\sec(x) \equiv \frac{1}{\cos x}$ (sec is read secant)
- The inverse function of $cos(x)$ is denoted $\cos^{−1}(x)$
- The cos function is even: $\cos(x) = \cos(−x)$
- The number $\cos(\theta)$ is the length-ratio of the horizontal side and the hypotenuse in a right-angle triangle with angle $\theta$ at the base.
### Tangent
The tangent function is the ratio of the sine and cosine functions:
$$f(x) = \tan(x) \equiv \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$$

![[1.14-tangent.jpg|center|500]]
#### Properties
- Domain: $\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \neq \frac{(2n+1)\pi}{2} \text{ for any } n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
- Range: $x \in \mathbb{R}$
- The function tan is periodic with period $\pi$
- The $\tan$ function “blows up” at values of $x$ where $cos x = 0$
	- These are called asymptotes of the function
	- Their locations are $x = \ldots, \frac{-3\pi}{2}, \frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \ldots$
- Value at $x = 0$: $\tan(0) = \frac{0}{1} = 0$, because $sin(0) = 0$
- The number $\tan(\theta)$ is the length-ratio of the vertical and the horizontal sides in a right-angle triangle with angle $\theta$.
- The inverse function of $\tan(x)$ is $\tan^{−1}(x)$
- The inverse tangent function is used to compute the angle at the base in a right-angle triangle with horizontal side length $\ell_{h}$ and vertical side length $\ell_v$
  $\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\ell_v}{\ell_h}\right)$
### Exponential
The exponential function base $e = 2.7182818\dots$
$$ f(x)=e^x\equiv \exp(x)$$

![[1.14-exponential.jpg|center|500]]
#### Properties
- Domain: $x \in \mathbb{R}$ 
- Range: $e^x \in (0, \infty$
- The multiplication of exponential functions with the same base means that you add the exponents.
$$f(a)f(b)=f(a+b)\ since\ e^ae^b=e^{a+b}$$
- The derivative (the slope of the graph) is the exponential function: 
$$f(x) = e^x \implies f'(x) = e^x$$

In general, $f(x)=Ae^{\gamma x}$ where $A$ is the initial value and $\gamma$ is the _rate_ of the exponential.
- **For $\gamma > 0$,** the function $f(x)$ is increasing like in the image.
- **For $\gamma<0$,** the function is decreasing and tends to 0 for large values of $x$.
- $\gamma = 0$ is a special case since $e^0 = 1$, so $f(x)$ is a constant of $f(x)=A1^x=A$. 
### Natural logarithm
The natural logarithm function, the inverse function of the exponential $e^x$:
$$f(x) = ln(x) = log_{e}(x)$$

![[1.14-natural_log.jpg|center|500]]
### Function transformations
$\dots$
### General quadratic function
The general quadratic function takes the form
$$f(x) = A(x − h)^2 + k$$
where $x$ is the input, and $A$, $h$, and $k$ are the parameters.
#### Parameters
- $A$: the slope multiplier
	- The larger $abs(A)$, the steeper the slope.
	- If $A < 0$, the function opens downward.
- $h$: the horizontal displacement of the function
	- Notice that subtracting a number inside the bracket makes the function go to the right.
- $k$: the vertical displacement of the function
#### Graph
The graph illustrates a quadratic function with parameters $A = 1$, $h = 1$, and $k = −2$.

![[1.14-general-quadratic-fn.jpg|center|500]]

If a quadratic crosses the $x$-axis:  $f(x)=A(x-a)(x-b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the roots.
Another common way of writing a quadratic function is $f(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C$.
#### Properties
- There is a unique quadratic function that passes through any three points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$ if $x_1 \neq x2$, $x_2 \neq x_3$, and $x_1 \neq x_3$.
- The derivative of $f(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C$ is $f'0(x) = 2A^x + B$.
### General sine function
Introducing all possible parameters into the sine function:
$$f(x) = A\sin \bigg(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}x - \phi\bigg)$$
where $A$, $\lambda$, and $\phi$ are the function’s parameters.
#### Parameters
- $A$: the amplitude describes the distance above and below the $x$-axis that the function reaches as it oscillates.
- $\lambda$: the _wavelength_ of the function 
$$\lambda = \text{\{ the distance from one peak to the next \}}$$
- $\phi$: is a phase shift, analogous to the horizontal shift $h$
	- This number dictates where the oscillation starts
	- The default sine function has $\phi=0$, so it passes through the origin with an increasing slope.

The function $f(x) = \sin(x)$ 
- has wavelength $2\pi$  
- produces outputs that oscillate between $−1$ and $1$.

Multiplying the bare function by constant $A$ results in oscillations ranging between $−A$ and $A$.

When the input $x$ is scaled by the factor $\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ , the wavelength of the function becomes $\lambda$.
