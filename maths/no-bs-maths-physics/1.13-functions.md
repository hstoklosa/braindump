## 1.13 Functions
We use functions to describe the relationships between variables. 
- In particular, functions describe how one variable depends on another (modelling reality).

**For example:**
- The revenue $R$ from a music concert depends on the number of tickets sold $n$.
- If each ticket = \$25, the revenue from the concert can be written as a function of $n$: $R(n) = 25n$

To “know” a function, you must be able to understand and connect several of its aspects.
- **definition**, which describes exactly what the function does
- **graph** of the function; what the function looks like if you plot $x$ versus $f(x)$
- **values** of the function for some important inputs
- **relations** of the function to other functions
### Definitions
A function is a mathematical object that takes numbers as inputs and gives numbers as outputs.
- $f : A \to B$ denotes a function from the input set $A$ to the output set $B$.

Terms used to describe the input and output sets:
- The **domain** of a function is the set of allowed input values.
- The **image** / **range** is the set of all possible output values.
- The **codomain** describes the type of outputs.

Difference between the image of a function and its codomain:
- $f(x)=x^2$ is of the form $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, but not all outputs are possible.
- The image of $f(x)=x^2$ consists only of the non-negative real numbers.

A function is not a number; it is a mapping from numbers to numbers. 
For any input $x$, the output value of $f$ for that input is denoted $f(x)$ i.e., $f$ maps $x$ to $f(x)$.

Terminology to classify the type of mapping that a function performs:
- A function is **one-to-one** or **injective** if it maps different inputs to different outputs.
- A function is **onto** / **surjective** if it covers the entire output set.
	- In other words, if the image of the function is equal to the function’s codomain.
- A function is **bijective** if it is both **injective** and **surjective**. 
	- In this case, $f$ is a one-to-one correspondence between the input set and the output set.
		- For each of the possible outputs $y ∈ Y$ (surjective part), 
		- there exists exactly one input $x ∈ X$, such that $f(x) = y$ (injective part).
### Function composition
Combining two simple functions by chaining them together to build a more complicated function.

The function $f \circ g: A → C$ is defined through the formula $f \circ g (x) ≡ f(g(x))$

**For example:** $f \circ g (x) \equiv f(g(x)) = z$
1. First, $g: A \to B$ acts on some input $x$ to produce an intermediary value $y = g(x)$ in the set $B$.
2. The intermediary value $y$ is then passed through $f: B \to C$.
3. The final output value $z = f(y) = f(g(x))$ in the set $C$.
### Inverse function
Given a bijective function $f: A \to B$, there exists an inverse function $f^{−1}: B \to A$, which performs the inverse mapping of $f$.

If you start from some $x$, apply $f$, and then apply $f^{−1}$.
- $f^{−1}(f(x)) \equiv f^{−1} \circ f(x) = x$

### Handles on functions
The main handle for a function is its **definition**, but it is also important to “feel” what the function does intuitively.

**Table of values**
One simple way to represent a function is to pick random inputs and create a table of values i.e., a list of input-output pairs: $\{(x1, f(x1)), (x2, f(x2)), (x3, f(x3)), . . .\}$

**Function graph**
The horizontal axis, sometimes called the *abscissa*, is used to measure $x$.

The vertical axis is used to measure $f(x)$ — alias for the output value of $f$ is $y ≡ f(x)$

Each input-output pair of the function $f$ as a point $(x, y)$ in the coordinate system.

**Facts and properties**
- An example of a mathematical fact is $\sin(30 \deg) = \frac{1}{2}$
- An example of a mathematical relation is the equation $\sin^2x + \cos^2x = 1$, which indicates a link between the $sin$ function and the $cos$ function.

To develop mathematical skills, it is vital to practice path-building between related concepts by solving exercises and reading and writing mathematical proofs.
