## 1.05 Fractions
The rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of numbers written as a fraction of two integers: $$\mathbb{Q} \equiv \{\frac{m}{n} |\ \text{m and n are in}\ \mathbb{Z} \ \text{and}\ n \neq 0\}$$
- where $\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of integers $\mathbb{Z} ≡ \{. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$.
### Definitions
The fraction “$a$ over $b$” - $a/b \equiv a\ ÷\ b \equiv \frac{a}{b}$
- $b$ is called the _denominator_ 
- $a$ is called the _numerator_

### Addition of fractions
If the denominators are the same, it makes sense to add the numerators since they refer to parts of the same whole: $\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5}=\frac{3}{5}$

if the denominators are different, we rewrite the fractions so they have a _common denominator_ before we can add the numerators

We can obtain a common denominator by multiplying
- the first fraction by $\frac{d}{d} = 1$ 
- and the second fraction by $\frac{b}{b} = 1$.
$$\frac{a}{b}\ +\ \frac{c}{d}\ =\ \frac{a}{b}(\frac{d}{d})\ +\ (\frac{b}{b}) \frac{c}{d}\ =\ \frac{ad}{bd}\ +\ \frac{bc}{bd}$$

More generally, we can pick the least common multiple $LCM(b, d)$ to use as the common denominator.

The $LCM$ of two numbers is obtained by multiplying the numbers together and removing their common factors.
$$LCM(b, d)\ =\ \frac{b\ \times\ d}{GCD(b, d)}$$
where $GCD(b, d)$ is the greatest common divisor (largest number that divides both numbers) of $b$ and $d$.

**For example:** $\frac{1}{6}\ +\ \frac{1}{15}\ =\ \frac{5\ \times\ 1}{5\ \times\ 6}\ +\ \frac{1\ \times\ 2}{15\ \times\ 2}\ =\ \frac{5}{30}\ +\ \frac{2}{30}\ =\ \frac{7}{30}$

$LCM$ and $GCD$ is not required. If you use the common denominator $b\ \times\ d$, you will arrive at the same answer as above:
$$\frac{1}{6}\ +\ \frac{1}{15}\ =\ \frac{15\ \times\ 1}{15\ \times\ 6}\ +\ \frac{1\ \times\ 6}{15\ \times\ 6}\ =\ \frac{15}{90}\ +\ \frac{6}{90}\ =\ \frac{21}{90}\ =\ \frac{7}{30}$$
### Multiplication of fractions
Multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together:
$$\frac{a}{b}\ \times\ \frac{c}{d}\ =\ \frac{a\ \times\ c}{b\ \times\ d}\ =\ \frac{ac}{bd}$$
### Division of fractions
Compute the product of the first fraction times the second fraction flipped:
$$\frac{a/b}{c/d}\ =\ \frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d}\ =\ \frac{a}{b}\ \times\ \frac{d}{c}\ =\ \frac{a\ \times\ d}{b\ \times\ c}\ =\ \frac{ad}{bc}$$
### Whole and fraction notation
To indicate an improper fraction like $\frac{5}{3}$ which is greater than $1$, we sometimes use the $1\frac{2}{3}$ notation.
### Repeating decimals
We use the overline notation to indicate the digit(s) that repeat in the expansion:
$$\frac{1}{3}\ =\ 0.3\ =\ 0.333\dots; \frac{1}{7}\ =\ 0.\overline{142857}\ =\ 0.14285714285714\dots$$
