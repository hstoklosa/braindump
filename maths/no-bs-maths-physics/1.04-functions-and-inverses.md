## 1.04 Functions and their inverses
By definition, $f^{-1}$ performs the opposite action of $f$ so together the two functions cancel each other out.

**Example:** Solving for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = c$. 
- The inverse function $f^{-1}$ to undo effects of $f$ 
- Then apply $f^{-1}$ to both sides of the equation $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x = f^{-1}(c)$

This notation is borrowed from the notion of inverse numbers $a^{-1}ax=1x=x$. In the case of functions, the negative-one exponent refers to the function’s inverse.
$$f^{−1}(y) = x\ \text{ s.t., }\ f(x) = y$$
**Note:** in some cases, applying the inverse leads to multiple solutions.
- For example $f(x) = x^2$ maps $x$ and $−x$ to the same output value.
- The inverse function of $f(x) = x^2$ is $f^{-1} (x) = \sqrt x$
- This equation’s solutions can be indicated by $x=\pm\ \sqrt{ c }$
### Formulas
A list of common functions and their inverses:
- $f(x) ⇔ f^{-1}(x)$
- $x+2 ⇔ x - 2$
- $2x ⇔ \frac{1}{2}x$
-  $-x ⇔ -x$
- $x^2 ⇔ \pm\ \sqrt x$
- $2^x ⇔ \log_{2} (x)$
- $3x+5 ⇔ \frac{1}{3}(x-5)$
- $a^x ⇔ \log_a(x)$
- $exp(x) \equiv e^x ⇔ \ln(x) \equiv \log_{e}(x)$ 
- $sin(x) ⇔ sin^{-1}(x) \equiv arcsin(x)$
- $cos(x) ⇔ cos^{-1}(x) \equiv arccos(x)$

### Discussion
There’s no general formula for solving complicated equations
- technique of “digging toward $x$” is sufficient for most problems
- rest requires solving the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

Solving third-degree polynomial equations like $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$ is possible by hand, but might as well start using a computer.

The principle of “digging” toward the unknown by applying inverse functions is the key for solving all these types of equations.
