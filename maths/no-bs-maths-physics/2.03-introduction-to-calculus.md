## 2.03 Introduction to calculus
Calculus is the study of functions and their properties with 2 operations:
- **derivatives** to describe how quantities _change over time_
- **integrals** to calculate the total amount of a quantity _accumulated_ over a time period
### Derivatives
The derivative function $f'(t)$ describes how the function $f(t)$ changes over time.
- encodes the information about the _instantaneous rate of change_ of $f(t)$
- equivalent to the _slope_ of the graph of the function at that point

$$f'(t) \equiv \text{slope}_f(t) = \frac{\text{change in }f(t)}{\text{change in }t} = \frac{f(t + \Delta t) - f(t)}{\Delta t}$$
In general, the instantaneous slope of a function is different for different values of $t$.

The derivative operation is denoted by several names and symbols: $$Df(t) = f' (t) = \frac{df}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\{f(t)\} = \dot{a}$$
Think of $f'(t)$ as a property of the function $f(t)$ - an operator $\frac{d}{dt}$ that you can apply to any function to obtain its slope information.
### Integrals
An integral corresponds to the computation of the area enclosed between the curve $f(t)$ and the $x$-axis over some interval:
$$A(a,b) \equiv \int_{t=a}^{t=b} f(t) \, dt$$

Symbol $\int$ means sum, and the area under the curve corresponds to the sum of the values of $f(t)$ between $t=a$ and $t=b$.

The integral is the total of $f$ between $a$ and $b$.
- A total function is **a function that is defined for every possible input in its domain, and always returns a valid output in its range**.

#### Inverse operations
The integral is the inverse operation of the derivative. Understanding the inverse relationship will allow you to solve for the unknown function in some equations.

Similarly to functions, we use the integral operation to undo the effects of the derivative operation when we try to solve for some unknown $f(t)$.

**For example:** suppose $g(t)$ is a known function and we’re trying to solve for $f(t)$:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\{f(t)\} = g(t)$$
Taking the integral on the left-hand side of the equation will undo the derivative.
$$\int \frac{d}{dt}\{f(t)\} \, dt = \int g(t) \, dt$$
To keep the equality true, we must apply the “integrate over t” operation on both sides of the equation.
$$f(t) = \int g(t) \, dt$$
The integral isn’t exactly the inverse of the derivative — there is an extra constant factor that appears when integrating.

**For example:** 
Given the derivative function $f'(t)$, integrate it between $t = 0$ and $t = \tau$.
- Intuitively, this integral corresponds to calculating the **total of the changes** in $f(t)$ during that time interval.
- Recall the notation “change in $f$” i.e., $\Delta f \equiv f(\tau) − f(0)$ 

$\Delta f$ makes it easier to visualise how the integral over $f'(t)$ corresponds to the total change in $f(t)$ between $t=0$ and $t=\tau$.
$$\int_0^{\tau} f'(t) \, dt = \Delta f \equiv f(\tau) - f(0)$$
Calculating the total of the instantaneous changes in $f$ during the interval $[0, \tau]$
$$f(\tau) = f(0) + \int_0^{\tau} f'(t) \, dt$$
**Note:** 
- The expression for $f(\tau)$ depends on the value of $f(t)$ at $t = 0$, which we call the _initial value_ of the function.
- In physics problems, the initial values of the equations of motion $x(0) \equiv x_i$ and $v(0) \equiv v_i$ are called the _initial conditions_.
