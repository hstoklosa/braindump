## 5.06 Derivatives
This [[2-physics#2.3 Introduction to calculus|section]] has identified the derivative with the slope of the function’s graph.
- That graphical representation and the intuition behind it are very important.
- Now, understanding the formal definition of the derivative operation.
### Definition
The derivative of a function is defined as $$f'(x) \equiv \lim_{\delta\ \to\ 0} \frac{f(x + \delta) - f(x)}{\delta}$$
The definition comes from the $\Delta y$ rise-over-run$\Delta x$ formula for calculating the slope of a line.
- The formula represents the **average rate of change** (or slope), not just the change in $f(x)$.
- Whereas, $\Delta f$ refers to a change in the function value, specifically $f(x+\delta) - f(x)$.
$$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_f - y_i}{x_f - x_i} = \frac{f(x + \delta) - f(x)}{(x + \delta) - x} = \frac{f(x + \delta) - f(x)}{\delta}$$




By making $\delta$ tend to zero, we are able to obtain the slope of the function $f(x)$ at the point $x$.

Different ways to denote derivatives: $Df(x) \equiv f'(x) \equiv \frac{d}{dx}f(x) \equiv \frac{df}{dx} \equiv \dot{f} \equiv \nabla f$

### The power rule
The derivative formula obtained in the last example is a special case of the general formula for computing derivatives of powers of $x$. $$\text{If } \quad f(x) = x^n \quad \text{ then } \quad f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$$

### Applications of derivatives
#### Optimization
Consider some real-world problem in which a quantity is described by the function $f(x)$.

The derivative function $f'(x)$ describes how the quantity changes over time, but often we only care about the sign of the derivative.
- if $f'(x) > 0$; the function is increasing
- if $f′(x) < 0$; the function is decreasing

If the function is horizontal at a certain point $x = x_0$, then $f'(x_0) = 0$.
The points where $f;(x) = 0$ are important for finding the maximum and minimum values of $f(x)$.

 The rule _“the max is where the derivative is zero”_ to calculate the maximum height h reached by a ball thrown in the air.
 - The top of the ball’s trajectory as the location when its velocity in the $y$-direction equals 0
 - The ball moves upward initially $(v_y > 0)$, stops momentarily at its maximum height $(v_y = 0)$, then moves downward $(v_y < 0)$ until it comes back to the ground.
 - Find the time $t_{top}$ by solving the equation $v_y (t_{top}) = 0$, which is the same as $y'(t_{top}) = 0$.
 - Substitute this value into the equation for $y(t)$ to obtain $h = max\{y(t)\} = y(t_{top})$.
#### Tangent lines
The _tangent line_ to $f(x)$ at $x = x_0$ is the line with slope $f'(x_0)$ that passes through the point $(x_{0}, f(x_{0}))$.
- $x_0$ is the $x$-coordinate and input to $f(x)$
- has slope $f'(x_0 )$, matching the slope of the curve at that point

The tangent line $T_{1}(x)$ is special because:
- It only “touches” the function at a single point.
- A single $T_{1}(x)$ exists that touches the function.

Calculate the equation of the tangent line at $x = x_0$.
- Looking for the equation of the line $T_1(x) = mx + b$ 
	- passes through the point $(x_0, f(x_0))$ 
	- has the slope of $f'(x_0)$.
- $m=f'(x_0)$, since $m$ represents the slope of the line.
- It passes through $(x_0, f(x_0))$, so initial value $b$ is found by solving $f(x_0)=T_1(x_0)=f'(x_0)x_0+b$.
- Solving for $b$ gives $b=f(x_0)-f'(x_0)x_0$, hence $T_1(x) = \underbrace{f(x_0)}_{(c)} + \underbrace{f'(x_0)(x-x_0)}_{(\ell)}.$

The expression describes $T_1(x)$ as the sum of 
- a constant term $c$ 
- $\ell$ proportional to the shifted coordinate $(x − x_0)^1$ centred at $x_0$.

The tangent line $T_1(x)$ is the best linear approximation to $f(x)$ near the coordinate $x = x_0$. 
- Written informally: $f(x) \approx T_1(x) \text{ for } x \text{ near } x_0$
