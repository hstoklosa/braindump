Resources on Haskell

- statically typed and purely functional
- with type inference and lazy evaluation

and some on functional programming in general.

_"... there's not a lot of resources on how to best use the tools that Haskell provides. Lots of terms and buzzwords, not a lot of in-depth practical guidance on best practices."_
