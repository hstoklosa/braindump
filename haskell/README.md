Resources on Haskell

- statically typed and purely functional
- with type inference and lazy evaluation

and some on functional programming in general.

## Resources

### [List of Articles on Design and Testing](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-24-design-and-testing-articles.html)

_"... there's not a lot of resources on how to best use the tools that Haskell provides. Lots of terms and buzzwords, not a lot of in-depth practical guidance on best practices."_

## Blogs

### [Kowainik](https://haskellweekly.news/)

A blog from a small team of enthusiasts developing a bunch of libraries and tools using functional technologies and providing learning materials.

### [William Yao](https://williamyaoh.com/)

_"Here, on this blog, is where you'll find no-nonsense explanations of Haskell concepts, written in plain English, connected to the real-world applications you'll use them for."_
