# ðŸ§  braindump: neural noise cancellation

This is a repository where I store and publish information (i.e., valuable resources and key learnings) that I may want to access in the future, because you never know when you will need to recall something.

Simply, this is an attempt to solve the problem of finding myself drowning in _**open tabs**_, _**scattered lists**_, and _**forgotten bookmarks**_ when studying/working.

As a side note, most of the documents in here will be concise, thus mainly containing reading lists and digested pieces of information, since I only wish to capture the essence of the content for better recall.
