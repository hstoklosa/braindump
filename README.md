# ðŸ§  braindump: neural noise cancellation

This is a repository where I store and publish information (e.g., valuable resources and key learnings) that I may want to access in the future, because you never know when you will need to recall something, or when someone else will.

I often find myself drowning in **open tabs**, **scattered lists** , and **forgotten bookmarks**, therefore I will attempt to centralise my knowledge here.

As a side note, most of the documents in this public space will be concise, thus mainly containing:

- Reading lists consisting of links to articles, books, and so on.
- Digested series of information (notes, text snippets) on specific topics.

since I only wish to capture the essence of the content for better recall.
