# Uninstall Python on Ubuntu 20.04

To uninstall Python (like version 3.10) on Ubuntu 20.04, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
sudo apt-get remove python3.10
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

## Command Explanations

```bash
sudo apt-get clean
```

- cleans up the local repository of downloaded package files
- removes all .deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/
- helps free up disk space

```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
```

- removes unused packages/dependencies that were automatically installed
- --purge flag removes the packages along with their configuration files
- more thorough than regular autoremove

```bash
sudo apt-get remove python3.10
```

- uninstalls Python 3.10 from the system
- keeps configuration files (unlike purge which would remove them)

```bash
4. `sudo apt-get autoremove`
```

- removes any remaining dependencies that were installed with Python 3.10

- cleans up packages that are no longer needed
